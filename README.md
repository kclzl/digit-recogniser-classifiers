# digit-recogniser-classifiers
Predict handwritten digits using 3 classifiers (LDA, QDA and Naive Bayes). This project is an in-dept analysis on 3 different classifiers - Naive Bayes, Linear Discriminant Classifier and Quadratic Discriminant classifier.
The aim of this project is not soley on accuracy of the classifiers but rather, the analysis of using classifiers as a possible solution to recognize handwritten digits and evaluating each classifer from a statistical, mathematical and computational standpoint.
The dataset is from the popular MNIST dataset with my hopes of improving it in the future.
